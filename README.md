## Database Setup
This project uses a SQL Server LocalDB database, which is typically located in the `App_Data` folder of the Visual Studio solution. The database file (`.mdf`) is included directly within the project.

1.  **Database File Location:**
    * The database file is named `AwesomeAC_DB.mdf` and is located in the `App_Data` folder within the Visual Studio solution.
2.  **Connection String:**
    * The `Web.config` file in the project root contains the connection string that points to this LocalDB database. It should look similar to this:
        ```xml
        <connectionStrings>
            <add name="AACDBConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\AwesomeAC_DB.mdf;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
        </connectionStrings>
        ```
        * **Note:** `|DataDirectory|` is a special ASP.NET placeholder that resolves to the `App_Data` folder at runtime. `(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB` refers to the default LocalDB instance provided by Visual Studio.
    * **No manual SQL Server setup (like SSMS) is typically required for LocalDB if the `.mdf` file is already in `App_Data` and the connection string is correct.** Visual Studio handles attaching the database automatically.

## Local Setup Instructions
To run this project locally using Visual Studio 2022:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Visual Studio 2022 (with "ASP.NET and web development" workload and ".NET Framework project and item templates" installed).
    * SQL Server LocalDB (usually installed with Visual Studio).
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kl99-chi/awesome-athletics-club-system.git
    ```
    (This URL uses your specific GitHub username and repository name.)
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd awesome-athletics-club-system
    ```
4.  **Open in Visual Studio:**
    * Open the `.sln` (solution) file (e.g., `AAC_System.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.
5.  **Restore NuGet Packages:**
    * In Visual Studio, right-click on your solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages" if prompted.
6.  **Verify Connection String:**
    * Ensure the connection string in your `Web.config` file correctly points to the `AwesomeAC_DB.mdf` database file in `App_Data` as shown in the [Database Setup](#database-setup) section.
7.  **Run the application:**
    * Press `F5` or click the "IIS Express" button in Visual Studio to run the application.
